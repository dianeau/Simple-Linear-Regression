# From all above  value or correlation coe.r is 0.94 which is good ,
# function is linear in nature i.e. lm(WG ~ Calories), 
# Coe. are significant and coe.of Determination value is R^2 is 0.89 which is also good
# sum of errors is 6.750156e-14 which is almost 0 and errors are almost normally distributed.
# RMSE value is 103.30 which is nearest to lower range value of weight gain
# so model is best fit
